# Downloadable
This is a simple Chrome extension for downloading videos from Streamable and Streamin.

## Purpose
I wanted an easy way to download videos from Streamable/Streamin, so I don't have to waste time with accounts/3rd party sites/html searching.
Also, I wanted to create an extension since I had never done this before, and this seemed as good a reason as any.

## Installation
1. Download/Clone repo files.
2. Open Chrome and go to **chrome://extensions/**.
3. Enable **"Developer mode"** (Top right corner).
4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the folder containing files.

## How to use
Just open the extension window when viewing any Streamable/Streamin video and click download.
